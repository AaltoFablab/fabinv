The Fab Lab inventory. The easy way. 

Ever not been able to find stuff and to get started at a place like a Fab Lab? This tool is there to help you. It aims to be as simple as possible to help you manage and find stuff easily.

## Next Steps

One could try the README-driven-development strategy here.

- [ ] For the backend Python would be the easiest I believe. Let's try the [graphene](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphene) GraphQL library and build a simple end-point which would return us a fake inventory table.
- [ ] For that GraphQL endpoint, let's build a front-end. Which framework to use has to be decided, but we could go with RiotJS and JQuery, using Skeleton for style initially.
